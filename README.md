Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their Android-only application to other systems. The application is a game called Draw It or Lose It, loosely based on the Win, Lose, or Draw game show. 
  The client needs their application to be available on web-based platforms, with the option to have multiple games running concurrently, with multiple teams in each game and multiple players on each team.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I feel that I filled out the documentation for this client rather well. In particular, the explanation of the class diagram was solid, and I also feel I filled out the Evaluation table well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  While developing the code, I really appreciated the class diagram. It helped to guide how each class should be built and what to include in each. It also helped to visualize the relationships between the classes to better understand how they interact.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would like to redo the requirements and design constraints sections. After completing this course, I feel better equipped to fill out these sections.
  I would add more detail, especially to the design constraints, focusing on systems architectures and possible hardware needs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  This is a hard question to answer, as for the most part the software was already designed. I just incorporated a few small parts that were required, such as using a singleton pattern for the game service class.
  It is always important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are who the software is for. You aren't writing it for yourself. If you do not take the user's needs into account, you will produce
  a product that is subpar or maybe not even usable by the client.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Again, most of the software was already produced for me, so I don't feel I had to design much. I followed the requirements for the project, and that worked pretty well. I did overlook implementation of the iterator pattern, as I just did not understand it
  well enough to implement it with confidence. In the future, I would use a similar singleton pattern to instantiate a single service class, like the game service in the project. I would also do more research into the other design patterns that were not used
  for this project to see if they would fit my future project's needs.
